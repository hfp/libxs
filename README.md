# LIBXS
Library for small matrix-matrix multiplications targeting Intel Architecture (x86). The library generates code for the following instruction set extensions: Intel SSE3, Intel AVX, Intel AVX2, IMCI (KNCni) for Intel Xeon Phi coprocessors ("KNC"), and Intel AVX-512 as found in the Intel Xeon Phi processor family ("KNL") and future Intel Xeon processors. Historically the library was solely targeting the Intel Many Integrated Core Architecture "MIC") using intrinsic functions, however meanwhile optimized assembly code is generated.

**What is a small matrix-matrix multiplication?** When characterizing the problem size using the M, N, and K parameters, a problem size suitable for LIBXS falls approximately within (M N K)^(1/3) <= 60 (which illustrates that non-square matrices or even "tall and skinny" shapes are covered as well). However the code generator only generates code up to the specified [threshold](#auto-dispatch). Raising the threshold may not only generate excessive amounts of code (due to unrolling), but also missing to implement a tiling scheme to effectively utilize the L2 cache. For problem sizes above the configurable threshold, LIBXS is falling back to BLAS.

**How to determine whether an application can benefit from using LIBXS or not?** Given the application uses BLAS to carry out matrix multiplications, one may link against Intel MKL 11.2 (or higher), set the environment variable MKL_VERBOSE=1, and run the application using a representative workload (env MKL_VERBOSE=1 ./workload > verbose.txt). The collected output is the starting point for evaluating the problem sizes as imposed by the workload (grep -a "MKL_VERBOSE DGEMM" verbose.txt | cut -d, -f3-5).

## Interface
The interface of the library is *generated* according to the [Build Instructions](#build-instructions), and are therefore **not** stored in the code repository. Instead, one may have a look at the code generation template files for [C/C++](https://github.com/hfp/libxs/blob/master/src/libxs.template.h) and [FORTRAN](https://github.com/hfp/libxs/blob/master/src/libxs.template.f90). To perform the matrix-matrix multiplication *c*<sub>*m* x *n*</sub> = *c*<sub>*m* x *n*</sub> + *a*<sub>*m* x *k*</sub> \* *b*<sub>*k* x *n*</sub>, the following interfaces can be used:

```C
/** If non-zero function pointer is returned, call (*function)(M, N, K). */
libxs_smm_function libxs_smm_dispatch(int m, int n, int k);
libxs_dmm_function libxs_dmm_dispatch(int m, int n, int k);
/** Automatically dispatched matrix-matrix multiplication. */
void libxs_smm(int m, int n, int k, const float* a, const float* b, float* c);
void libxs_dmm(int m, int n, int k, const double* a, const double* b, double* c);
/** Non-dispatched matrix-matrix multiplication using inline code. */
void libxs_simm(int m, int n, int k, const float* a, const float* b, float* c);
void libxs_dimm(int m, int n, int k, const double* a, const double* b, double* c);
/** Matrix-matrix multiplication using BLAS. */
void libxs_sblasmm(int m, int n, int k, const float* a, const float* b, float* c);
void libxs_dblasmm(int m, int n, int k, const double* a, const double* b, double* c);
```

With C++ and FORTRAN function overloading, the library allows to omit the 's' and 'd' denoting the numeric type in the above C interface. Further, in C++ a type 'libxs_mm_dispatch<*type*>' can be used to instantiate a functor rather than making a distinction for the numeric type in 'libxs_?mm_dispatch'.

# Performance
## Auto-dispatch
The function 'libxs_?mm_dispatch' helps amortizing the cost of the dispatch when multiple calls with the same M, N, and K are needed. In contrast, the automatic code dispatch uses three levels:

1. Specialized routine (implemented in assembly code),
2. Inlinable C/C++ code or optimized FORTRAN code, and
3. BLAS library call.

All three levels are accessible directly (see [Interface](#interface)) in order to allow a customized code dispatch. The level 2 and 3 may be supplied by the Intel Math Kernel Library (Intel MKL) 11.2 DIRECT CALL feature. Beside of the generic interface, one can call a specific kernel e.g., 'libxs_dmm_4_4_4' multiplying 4x4 matrices. For the latter, the code generator includes prototypes for all specialized functions into the generated interface (header file).

Further, a preprocessor symbol denotes the largest problem size (*M* x *N* x *K*) that belongs to level (1) and (2), and therefore determines if a matrix-matrix multiplication falls back to level (3) of calling the LAPACK/BLAS library linked with the LIBXS. This threshold can be configured using for example:

```
make THRESHOLD=$((24 * 24 * 24))
```

The maximum of the given threshold and the largest requested specialization refines the value of the threshold. If a problem size falls below the threshold, dispatching the code requires to figure out whether a specialized routine exists or not. This can be implemented by bisecting a table of all specialized functions (binary search). At the expense of storing function pointers for the entire problem space below the threshold, a direct lookup can be used instead. The actual behavior can be configured using for example:

```
make SPARSITY=2
```

A binary search is implemented when a sparsity (calculated at construction time of the library) is above the given SPARSITY value. Raising the given value prevents generating a binary search (and generates a direct lookup) whereas a value below or equal one is generating the binary search. Furthermore, the size of the direct lookup table is limited to 512 KB (currently hardcoded). The overhead of auto-dispatched multiplications based on the binary search becomes negligible with reasonable problem sizes (above ~20x20 matrices), but may be significant for very small auto-dispatched matrix-matrix multiplication.

## Implementation
## Roadmap
Although the library is under development, the published interface is rather stable and may only be extended in future revisions. The following issues are being addressed in upcoming revisions:

* Full xGEMM interface, and extended code dispatcher
* Just-in-Time (JIT) runtime dynamic code generation
* API supporting sparse matrices and other cases

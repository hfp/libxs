LIBXS is a small utility library with common (or not so common) functionality which has shown to be useful for a variety of applications.

* Histogram: can accumulate values and finally provide insight like running statistics.
* MHD: load and store multidimensional arrays (external viewers available).
* Math: data validation and accurate statistics, and related utilities.
* Malloc: preallocated pools for fast memory allocation (fly weight).
* Random: data initialization and random numbers.
* Utilities: macros, intrinsic layer, and more.
* Synchronization: portable locks and atomics.
* Memory: string utilities and data handling.
* CPUID: classification by ISA extensions.
* Timer: clock ticks and duration.

LIBXS was originally developed as part of LIBXSMM (existence started even prior to LIBXSMM).
